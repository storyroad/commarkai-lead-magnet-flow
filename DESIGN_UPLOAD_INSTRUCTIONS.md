# How to provide your MagicPatterns export

Preferred methods to give me the exported files to add to this branch:

1) Attach the exported ZIP directly to this PR as a file. GitHub lets you attach files to PR comments.
2) Upload the ZIP to a temporary cloud link (Google Drive, Dropbox) and paste the link in a PR comment (set link to Anyone with link can view).
3) If MagicPatterns supports GitHub export, push to a fork and provide the repo link.

Required items:
- All CSS and JS exported by MagicPatterns needed for the hero (or the hero HTML snippet)
- Images and SVGs used by the design (prefer optimized webp/png/svg)
- Fonts or fallback font-family instructions

Preferred folder structure once uploaded:
/design/import/your-export.zip
/design/import/assets/*
/design/import/hero.html

Once you attach the files here, comment on the PR or reply in this chat and I will merge them into the branch and create a preview.
