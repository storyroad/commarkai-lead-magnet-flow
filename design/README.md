# Design import (feature/magicpatterns-redesign)

This branch is a safe staging area for importing the MagicPatterns export and iterating on the visual redesign for commarkai.net.

How to provide files for this branch:

- Option A: Attach the exported ZIP from MagicPatterns to this PR as a file, or upload the ZIP to Google Drive/Dropbox and paste the link in the PR comments.
- Option B: If MagicPatterns supports GitHub export, push the exported files to a fork or temporary repo and link it here.
- Option C: Upload only the specific files you want added (SVG logos, images, CSS, and the hero HTML snippet) by replying in this conversation with the files attached; I will then update the branch.

What I'll do once you provide files:
- Integrate assets into /public or /design/import
- Add a preview route (/preview/hero) or update public/design-hero-prototype/index.html
- Update tokens.css and commit the color tokens
- Open or update the PR with screenshots & preview URL

Please include the reference image from this conversation for context.
